Schematic diagram:
Beta0.1.0 schematic completed
Beta0.1.1 has made its first volume control improvement
Beta0.1.2 has made the first cost control improvement
Beta0.1.3 modified three design defects
Beta0.1.4 Correct one detail and modify the introduction
Beta0.1.5 Replace materials to improve stability


PCB:
Beta0.1.0 First PCB design completed
Beta0.1.1 modified one design flaw (line width and current issues)
Beta0.1.2 modified one design defect (multiple pad conflicts)
Beta0.1.3 has modified one design flaw (two resistor trims)
Beta0.1.4 modified one design flaw (adding a capacitor)
Beta0.1.5 Modify the copper and border strategies
At this point, Beta0.1. x is invalid
Since it is invalid, this version of the file has been deleted, but I have kept a photo of it(Beta0.1.5 's photos)



Beta0.2.0 PCB design completed
Beta0.2.1 fixes C10-2 line width issue
Beta0.2.2 Fix button layout issues
Beta0.2.3 fixes line width and through-hole issues
Beta0.2.4 Fixing USB spacing issues
Beta0.2.5 Minor modification of wire spacing
Beta0.2.6 Update Components
Beta0.2.7 re layout; Control size; Suitable for mass production
Beta0.2.8 Optimize the route and optimize one through hole
Beta0.2.9 Re-optimize the route
Bate 0.2.10 greatly increases redundancy and optimizes routing
Bate 0.2.11 fixes the bug that vias are too close to the pad, which is easy to short circuit, and greatly optimizes the traces

Beta0.2.10 officially released
